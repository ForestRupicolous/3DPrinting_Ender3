# 3DPrinting_Ender3
Collection of stuff for Creality Ender 3 3D printer

## Build
Build using "Precision Alignment Guide" from Luke Hatfield (Thanks!!!) from facebook user group.

## Firmware
Flashed bootloader using Arduino Decimila as ArduinoISP. This needs an 100 Ohm Pull-Up between Arduino RST and 5V otherwise the uploader just finds the Decimila.
Installed firmeware using this bootloader.
Currently used Marlin 1.1.9 with configuration taken from https://github.com/wronex/Marlin-Ender-3
